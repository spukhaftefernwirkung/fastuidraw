- Create build directory, e.g. in the same parent directory as the fastuidraw sources directory.
- Run CMake:

    $ cmake -G Ninja -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DBUILD_GL:BOOL=ON -DBUILD_GLES:BOOL=OFF -DBUILD_DEMOS:BOOL=ON ../fastuidraw

  Other CMake generators than Ninja should work as well.
  If you get an error on CMP0004 policy when using SDL2: cfr. https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3295

  Standard CMake variables:
    - BUILD_SHARED_LIBS : ON -> shared libraries will be built, OFF -> static libraries will be built.
    - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE : Debug -> debug build; Release -> release build; other possible values: see CMake documentation.
  FastUIDraw CMake variables:
    - BUILD_DEMOS : Build the supplied demos (default: OFF).
    - BUILD_GL : Build the GL backend (default: ON).
    - BUILD_GLES : Build the GLES backend (default: OFF).
    Both backends can be enabled.
- Build:
    $ ninja
    or
    $ cmake --build .
- Demo executables and shared libraries (when configured to build shared libraries) are placed in subdirectory 'bin', ready to run.

When adding/removing *.resource_string files, run an explicit "cmake ." first before building.  The reason is that we use file(GLOB) to
locate those files and there is no dependency tracking for that.  An alternative is to explicitly list all resource_files like we do
for .cpp sources.
